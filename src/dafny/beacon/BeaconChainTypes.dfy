     *
     *  @link{https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/Bkn3zpwxB?type=view} 
     *  The beacon chain’s state (BeaconState) is the core object around 
     *  which the specification is built. The BeaconState encapsulates 
     *  all of the information pertaining to: 
     *      - who the validators are, 
     *      - in what state each of them is in, 
     *      - which chain in the block tree this state belongs to, and 
     *      - a hash-reference to the Ethereum 1 chain.
     *
     *  Beginning with the genesis state, the post state of a block is considered valid if 
     *  it passes all of the guards within the state transition function. Thus, the precondition 
     *  of a block is recursively defined as transition function on the previous block and its 
     *  state all the way back to the genesis state.
     *
     * @param   genesis_time        Tracks the Unix timestamp during which the genesis slot
     *                              occurred. 
     *                              This allows a client to calculate what the current slot 
     *                              should be according to wall-clock.
     *
     * @param   slot                Time is divided into “slots” of fixed length at which 
     *                              actions occur and state transitions happen. This field 
     *                              tracks the slot of the containing state, not necessarily 
     *                              the slot according to the local wall clock.
     *
     * @param   latest_block_header The latest block header seen in the chain defining this
     *                              state. This blockheader has During the slot transition of the
     *                              block, the header is stored without the real state root but 
     *                              instead with a stub of Root () (empty 0x00 bytes). At the start
     *                              of the next slot transition before anything has been modified
     *                              within state, the state root is calculated and added to the
     *                              latest_block_header. This is done to eliminate the circular 
     *                              dependency of the state root being embedded in the block header.
     *
     * @param   block_roots         Per-slot store of the recent block roots.The block root for a 
     *                              slot is added at the start of the next slot to avoid the 
     *                              circular dependency due to the state root being embedded in the
     *                              block. For slots that are skipped (no block in the chain for the
     *                              given slot), the most recent block root in the chain prior to 
     *                              the current slot is stored for the skipped slot. When 
     *                              validators attest to a given slot, they use this store of block
     *                              roots as an information source to cast their vote.
     *
     * @param   state_roots         Per-slot store of the recent state roots.The state root for a 
     *                              slot is stored at the start of the next slot to avoid a

     *                              added to the next block and processed if
