     *
     *  @link{https://notes.ethereum.org/@djrtwo/Bkn3zpwxB?type=view} 
     *  The beacon chain’s state (BeaconState) is the core object around 
     *  which the specification is built. The BeaconState encapsulates 
     *  all of the information pertaining to: 
     *      - who the validators are, 
     *      - in what state each of them is in, 
     *      - which chain in the block tree this state belongs to, and 
     *      - a hash-reference to the Ethereum 1 chain.
     *
     *  Beginning with the genesis state, the post state of a block is considered valid if 
     *  it passes all of the guards within the state transition function. Thus, the precondition 
     *  of a block is recursively defined as transition function on the previous block and its 
     *  state all the way back to the genesis state.
     *
     * @param   genesis_time        Tracks the Unix timestamp during which the genesis slot
     *                              occurred. 
     *                              This allows a client to calculate what the current slot 
     *                              should be according to wall-clock.
     *
     * @param   slot                Time is divided into “slots” of fixed length at which 
     *                              actions occur and state transitions happen. This field 
     *                              tracks the slot of the containing state, not necessarily 
     *                              the slot according to the local wall clock.
     *
     * @param   latest_block_header The latest block header seen in the chain defining this

     *                              block, the header is stored without the real state root but 
     *                              instead with a stub of Root () (empty 0x00 bytes). At the start
     *                              of the next slot transition before anything has been modified
     *                              within state, the state root is calculated and added to the
     *                              latest_block_header. This is done to eliminate the circular 
     *                              dependency of the state root being embedded in the block header.
     *
     * @param   block_roots         Per-slot store of the recent block roots.The block root for a 
     *                              slot is added at the start of the next slot to avoid the 
     *                              circular dependency due to the state root being embedded in the
     *                              block. For slots that are skipped (no block in the chain for the
     *                              given slot), the most recent block root in the chain prior to 
     *                              the current slot is stored for the skipped slot. When 
     *                              validators attest to a given slot, they use this store of block
     *                              roots as an information source to cast their vote.
     *
     * @param   state_roots         Per-slot store of the recent state roots.The state root for a 
     *                              slot is stored at the start of the next slot to avoid a

     *                              added to the next block and processed if

     * @link{https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/containers/execution/} 
     * The ExecutionPayload is a key component of the merge between Ethereum's
     * execution layer and consensus layer. It encapsulates all the information
     * necessary for the execution of transactions, including:
     *     - the state before transaction execution,
     *     - the transactions themselves,
     *     - the state after transaction execution, and
     *     - various elements necessary for proof-of-stake consensus.
     *
     * The ExecutionPayload is created by the execution client and provided to
     * the consensus client. It is used to propose a new block and contains all
     * the necessary data for the consensus client to validate and agree upon
     * the block contents without needing to execute transactions itself.
     *
     * @param parent_hash          Hash of the parent block, ensuring continuity in the blockchain.
     * @param fee_recipient        The address to which transaction fees are paid.
     * @param state_root           The post-transaction state root.
     * @param receipts_root        The root of the receipts trie, summarizing the effect of transactions.
     * @param logs_bloom           A bloom filter for the logs contained in the block, aiding in log retrieval.
     * @param prev_randao          The RANDAO value of the previous block, used in randomness generation.
     * @param block_number         The height of the block in the blockchain.
     * @param gas_limit            The current limit of gas expenditure per block.
     * @param gas_used             The total gas used by all transactions in this block.
     * @param timestamp            The timestamp at which the block was proposed.
     * @param extra_data           Additional data included by the proposer of the block.
     * @param base_fee_per_gas     The minimum fee per gas required for a transaction to be included in this block.
     * @param block_hash           The hash of the execution block, ensuring block uniqueness.
     * @param transactions         The list of transactions included in the block.
     * @param withdrawals          The list of withdrawals in the block, new in Capella upgrade.
     *
     * This datatype is essential in the post-merge Ethereum ecosystem, where the
     * consensus layer relies on the execution layer to provide it with succinct
     * proofs of the correct execution of transactions.

    /**
     * The ExecutionPayloadHeader type.
     *
     * @link{https://eth2book.info/capella/part3/containers/execution/}
     * The ExecutionPayloadHeader represents a condensed version of the ExecutionPayload,
     * containing all the critical header information of an execution block without the full
     * transaction and withdrawals data. This header is crucial for the consensus layer to
     * validate and agree upon block contents efficiently. It includes hashes of the transaction
     * and withdrawals data, allowing for a compact proof of the full payload.
     *
     * The ExecutionPayloadHeader is used within the consensus layer to maintain a light
     * reference to execution blocks, enabling validators to perform their duties without
     * processing the entire content of the execution layer's data, thus optimizing the
     * overall system performance.
     *
     * @param parent_hash          Hash of the parent block, establishing a link in the blockchain.
     * @param fee_recipient        The address credited with transaction fees from this block.
     * @param state_root           The root of the state trie after transaction execution.
     * @param receipts_root        The root of the trie containing receipts of all transactions.
     * @param logs_bloom           A bloom filter summarizing the event logs of the block.
     * @param prev_randao          The previous block's RANDAO value, used for entropy.
     * @param block_number         The sequential number of the block in the chain.
     * @param gas_limit            The maximum gas allowed in this block for executing transactions.
     * @param gas_used             The total gas used by transactions in this block.
     * @param timestamp            The time at which the block was proposed.
     * @param extra_data           Additional information provided by the block proposer.
     * @param base_fee_per_gas     The base fee per gas in the block, part of EIP-1559.
     * @param block_hash           The unique identifier of the block.
     *
     * Below are the main difference between ExecutionPayload and ExecutionPayloadHeader:
     *     - ExecutionPayloadHeader contains the Merkle root of the transactions and withdrawals.
     *
     * @param transactions_root    The Merkle root of the transactions trie, representing all transactions.
     * @param withdrawals_root     The Merkle root of the withdrawals trie, representing all withdrawals.
